# GraphQL Guide

This repo is for following GraphQL guide book

## Pre-requisites

- **Docker Desktop** installed
- Docker extensions in VS Code to open Development Container
- **Mongodb** Compass (Optional)
- Create database called **guide** in mongodb.
  - Create collection called **Users**
    - Insert JSON data in the collection.

**JSON Data To Insert In Collection Example:**

```json
[
  {
    "_id": "1",
    "username": "user1"
  },
  {
    "_id": "2",
    "username": "user2"
  },
  {
    "_id": "3",
    "username": "Shrek"
  },
  {
    "_id": "4",
    "username": "Batman"
  },
  {
    "_id": "5",
    "username": "Pikachu"
  }
]
```

## Express Server

Open `http://localhost:4000/graphql` 🚀 it will open **Apollo Server**

__Demo:__

# Chapter 1 Async Data Loading

1 - Create a new collection called `groups`, like this:

![Groups Collection](groups-collection.png)

After assign all users to a specific group, by creating a field called `groupId`. 

![Users Collection](users-collection.png)

__In this chapter I switched to Apollo Server__

# Chapter 2 Multiple types of data

```graphql
query ExampleQuery($groupId: String!, $userId: String) {
  users {
    _id
    username
    group {
      _id
      name
    }
  }
  groups {
    _id
    name
  }
  group(id: "author") {
    _id
    name
  }
  user(id: "4") {
    _id
    username
    group {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

Response:
```json

  "data": {
    "users": [
      {

## Operations

__Operations__
GraphQL is a specification for communicating with the server. We communicate with it—asking for data and telling it to do things—by sending _[operations](https://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sec-Language.Operations)_. There are three types of operations:
- `query` fetches data
- `mutation` changes and fetches data
- `subscription` tells the server to send data whenever a certain event occurs

__Operations__ can have names, like __AllTheStars__ in this query operation:
```graphql
query AllTheStars {
  githubStars
}
```

## Document

Similar to how we call a `JSON` file or `string` a `JSON` document, a GraphQL file or string is called a GraphQL _[document](https://spec.graphql.org/draft/)_. There are two types of GraphQL documents—executable documents and schema documents. In this chapter, we’ll mainly be discussing executable documents. An executable document is a list of one or more operations or [fragments](#fragments). Here’s a document with a query operation:
```graphql
query {
  githubStars
}
```

Our operation has a single root field, __githubStars__. In this type of document—a single query operation without [variables]() or [directives](#directives)—we can omit query, so the above document is equivalent to:

```graphql
{
  githubStars
}
```

A more complex document could be:

```graphql
query StarsAndChapter {
  githubStars
  chapter(id: 0) {
    title
  }
}

mutation ViewedSectionOne {
  viewedSection(id: "0-1") {
    ...sectionData
  }
}

mutation ViewedSectionTwo {
  viewedSection(id: "0-2") {
    ...sectionData
  }
}

fragment sectionData on Section {
  id
  title
}

subscription StarsSubscription {
  githubStars
}
```

It has all the operation types as well as a fragment. __Note__ that when we have more than one __operation__, we need to give each a name—in this case, __StarsAndChapter__, __ViewedSection__, and __StarsSubscription__.”

## Selection sets

The content between a pair of curly braces is called a [selection set](https://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sec-Selection-Sets)—the list of data fields we’re requesting. For instance, the __StarsAndChapter__ selection set lists the __githubStars__ and __chapter__ fields:

```graphql
{
  githubStars
  chapter(id: 0) {
    title
  }
}
```

And chapter has its own selection set: `{ title }`.

## Fields

A [field](https://spec.graphql.org/draft/) is a piece of information that can be requested in a selection set. In the above query, `githubStars`, `chapter`, and `title` are all fields. The first two are top-level fields (in the outer selection set, at the first level of indentation), and they’re called root query fields. Similarly, viewedSection in the document below is a root mutation field:
```graphql
mutation ViewedSectionTwo {
  viewedSection(id: "0-2") {
    ...sectionData
  }
}
```

## Arguments

On the server, a field is like a function that returns a value. Fields can have _[arguments](https://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sec-Language.Arguments)_: named values that are provided to the field function and change how it behaves. In this example, the `user` field has an `id` argument, and `profilePic` has `width` and `height` arguments:
```graphql
{
  user(id: 1) {
    name
    profilePic(width: 100, height: 50)
  }
}
```

Arguments can appear in any order.

## Variables



We often don’t know argument values until our code is being run—for instance, we won’t always want to query for user #1. The user ID we want will depend on which profile page we’re displaying. While we could edit the document at runtime (like `{ user(id: ' + currentPageUserId + ') { name }}'`), we recommend instead using static strings and _[variables](https://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sec-Language.Variables)_. __Variables__ are declared in the document, and their values are provided separately, like this:
```graphql
query UserName($id: Int!) { 
  user(id: $id) {
    name
  }
}

{
  "id": 2
}
```

After the operation name, we declare `($id: Int!)`: the name of the variable with a `$` and the type of the __variable__. `Int` is an `integer` and `!` means non-null (required). Then, we use the variable name `$id` in an argument in place of the value: `user(id: 2) => user(id: $id)`. Finally, we send a __JSON__ object with variable values along with the query document.
We can also give variables default values, for instance:
```graphql
query UserName($id: Int = 1) { 
  user(id: $id) {
    name
  }
}
```

If `$id` isn’t provided, `1` will be used.
